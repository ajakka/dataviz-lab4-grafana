# Lab 4 of data visualization using grafana

## Exercice 2 : Dashboarding for Server monitoring

For dashboarding, prometheus uses node_export to get host data.

The docker image does not work (from my experience) well

on macos, better intall it seperatly via brew `brew install node_exporter`

and then run the command `node_exporter` to launch it

## Exercice 3 : Building dashboards for controlling smart farms

For loging in to grafana, influxdb or nodered please use the

credencials below:

```
usr: dataviz
pas: dataviz123

or

pas: admin
